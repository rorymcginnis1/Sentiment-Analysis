# Sentiment-Analysis

## Description

Developed a sentiment analysis on tweets to using an MLP to determine if the tweets are positive, negative, irrelivent or neutral. 
Implimented Preprocessing techniques for cleaning and filtering the tweets. Created a custom PyTorch dataset for label processing 
and one-hot encoding. Evaluated the model performance on test set.

## Tools and frameworks
(Python, Pandas, NumPy, csikit-learn, PyTorach)

## Run

Downlaod the code and run it. The sentiment analysis training data file will be downloaded as well. 
Depending on your machine it may not be able to be ran, if it is not able to be ran [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com) 
can run it. Simply copy the code and paste it in colab and upload the training file.

Note: It may take several hours to train the entire dataset, if you would like to test it on a smaller dataset 
change line 102 in the code from n=70000 to n=(your choice) the smaller the number the faster it will train.
